message(STATUS "Including dependency: newlib")

# TODO
#
# We eventually want to write our own Libc instead of using newlib as newlib
# has some problems:
# - does not compile on Windows as it needs bash
# - it does not fully support Libc++, so we need some hacks to make it
#   work, including long double issues
# - It is a lot larger than we need, and if we want to use C++ in Shellcode,
#   we will need to ensure that the resulting binaries are as small as
#   possible.
# - Newlib itself has a lot of issues with how it was developed, and we would
#   like to add our best practices to how Libc was written to address that
#   including things like enabling all warnings, werror support, static
#   analysis, unit testing, etc.
#
# Also note that we have a step at the end that moves some directories around.
# This is because the GNU tools like to place everyting in "prefix/target",
# and we really want just "prefix" since that is what CMake does.
