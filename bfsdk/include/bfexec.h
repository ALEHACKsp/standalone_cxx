/**
 * Bareflank Execute
 *
 * The "bfexec" functions are similar to the "exec" functions. Both load a
 * program into the current process space and then execute it. There are some
 * key differences however:
 * - Unlike exec, bfexec doesn't have any OS specific dependencies. This allows
 *   it to work on any OS, or even on systems without an OS. As a result, it
 *   takes a buffer to an application and not a file path, since loading a file
 *   is OS/system specific.
 * - Since there are no OS specific dependencies, you must provide some helper
 *   functions that are needed (specifically with memory management and how to
 *   handle system calls).
 *
 * This version of the bfexec function takes an ELF file and the start
 * arguments and will then execute the application. This function will fill in
 * the ELF start args for you, but you do need to fill out the rest of the
 * arguments as needed. In general, unless you know what you are doing, do
 * not use this function and instead use the others.
 *
 * @param ef the ELF file to execute.
 * @param _start_args the start arguments to provide the _start function
 * @return BFSUCCESS on success, BFFAILURE otherwise
